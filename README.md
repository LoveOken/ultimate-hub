# ULTIMATE HUB

For One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

## ABOUT

+ **What:** Ultimate Hub is a website designed to create an online gaming experience of the popular social deduction card game, _One Night Ultimate Werewolf_.
+ **How:** The website is constructed with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, JS, HTML and CSS.
+ **Why:** The website is made to fulfill the lack of sites designed for playing the game, and to create an enjoyable and user-friendly experience, within a community full of contributive and rich activity.

## FEATURES

1. The website's structure is **Lobby Based**, in other words, there exists a lobby in which you can create **Tables**. The tables are confined sites, in which games develop independently from other tables. The lobby will also give you access to view and to enter other tables.
2. The website's users communicate through **Chat Rooms**. First, there exists the global chat room, in which you can talk to every player online. Second, every table has a private chat room, in which you can only talk to every player inside of the table. (WIP)
3. The website provides a clean aesthetic and clear UI design, animations to make the game understandable and approachable, and sound effects to alert the players of important actions within the game. (WIP)
4. The website utilizes **User Registers** for managing the clients. (WIP)

## STRUCTURE

The code is divided into separate folders for each module:

### Backend Folder

The Backend Folder exclusively consists of modules that affect routing, packaging and communication of the app directly.

+ The **Express Module** goes inside this folder.
+ The **Socket.io Module** goes inside this folder.

### Main Folder

The Main Folder consists of all the remaining content of the game.

+ All HTML files go inside this folder.
+ Subfolder:
	1. **Javascript Folder**: All Javascript files go inside this folder. If any subfolder here is named after any previous HTML documents, All Javascript files used on that HTML document go inside this folder. All Javascript files, used on all the HTML document, go inside the folder _utils_.
	2. **CSS Folder**: All style sheets go inside this folder.
	3. **Image Folder**: All images and sprites go inside this folder.
