# CONTRIBUTIONS

All contributions are well received.

My protocols are:

+ **For JS,** use of prototypes is key in this project. The prototype is the minimum construction unit.
+ **For CSS,** order of properties is alphabetical. Order of denominators is determined by position.
+ **For HTML,** names are in uppercase. CSS goes at the top. Scripts go at the bottom, except for reloading scripts.
+ **Names of files** are in uppercase. Other naming conventions to be determined.

Use of prettifiers and linters will be specified soon.
